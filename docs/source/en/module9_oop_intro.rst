Module 9: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Modeling Your World
==================================================================

Welcome to Module 9! So far, we've primarily used a procedural programming style, where programs are sequences of instructions and function calls. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a powerful programming paradigm that structures a program around "objects" rather than "actions" and "data" rather than "logic." Objects are instances of **classes**, which bundle data (attributes) and functions that operate on that data (methods) together. OOP helps in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code by modeling real-world entities and their interactions.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the core concepts of OOP: classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
*   Define classes in Python using the `class` keyword.
*   Create objects (instances) from classes.
*   Understand and use the `__init__` method (constructor) to initialize object attributes.
*   Understand the role of `self` in instance methods.
*   Define and call instance methods that operate on object data.

What is Object-Oriented Programming?
====================================

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". These objects can contain data in the form of fields (often known as **attributes** or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as **methods**). A key feature of objects is that an object's own methods can access and often modify its own data fields.

Core OOP Concepts:
------------------
1.  **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that all objects of that class will have. For example, a `Car` class could define attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `start_engine()` and `accelerate()`.
2.  **Object (Instance):** A specific instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from the class blueprint. For example, `my_red_toyota` could be an object of the `Car` class. Each object has its own values for the attributes defined by the class.
3.  **Attribute:** A piece of data associated with an object (or class). It represents a characteristic or property of the object. (e.g., `color` for a `Car` object).
4.  **Method:** A function that is associated with an object (or class). It defines a behavior or action that the object can perform. (e.g., `start_engine()` for a `Car` object).
5.  **Encapsulation:** The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way to prevent accidental modification of data (data hiding).
6.  **Inheritance:** A mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchy of classes.
7.  **Polymorphism:** (Greek for "many forms") The ability of an object to take on many forms. In practice, it means that a call to a member method will cause a different method to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the method. For example, different animal objects might have a `make_sound()` method, but each will produce a different sound.

----------------------------------------------------

Classes and Objects in Python
=============================

Defining a Class
----------------
You define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name (typically in `CamelCase` convention) and a colon. The class body is indented.

.. code-block:: python

    class Dog:  # Class definition
        """A simple class representing a dog."""

        # Class attribute (shared by all instances of the class)
        species = "Canis familiaris"

        # Initializer / Constructor method
        def __init__(self, name, age, breed="Unknown"):
            """Initializes a new Dog object."""
            # Instance attributes (specific to each instance)
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            self.breed = breed
            self.is_sitting = False # Default state
            print(f"Dog named {self.name} created!")

        # Instance method
        def bark(self):
            """Makes the dog bark."""
            return f"{self.name} says: Woof!"

        # Another instance method
        def sit(self):
            """Makes the dog sit."""
            if not self.is_sitting:
                self.is_sitting = True
                print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")
            else:
                print(f"{self.name} is already sitting.")

        def stand(self):
            """Makes the dog stand."""
            if self.is_sitting:
                self.is_sitting = False
                print(f"{self.name} is now standing.")
            else:
                print(f"{self.name} is already standing.")

        def get_details(self):
            """Returns a string with the dog's details."""
            return f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, Breed: {self.breed}, Species: {self.species}"

Key Components:
*   **`class Dog:`**: Defines a new class named `Dog`.
*   **Docstring:** `"""A simple class representing a dog."""` describes the class.
*   **Class Attribute (`species`):** `species = "Canis familiaris"` is an attribute shared by all instances (objects) of the `Dog` class. You can access it via the class itself (`Dog.species`) or an instance (`my_dog.species`).
*   **`__init__` Method (Constructor):**
    *   This is a special method that gets called automatically when you create a new object (instance) of the class.
    *   The name `__init__` is flanked by double underscores (dunder method).
    *   Its primary purpose is to initialize the instance attributes of the object.
*   **`self` Parameter:**
    *   The first parameter of any instance method (including `__init__`) is conventionally named `self`.
    *   It refers to the instance (object) itself that the method is being called on. Python passes this automatically.
    *   You use `self` to access or modify the instance's attributes (e.g., `self.name = name`).
*   **Instance Attributes (`name`, `age`, `breed`, `is_sitting`):** These are attributes that are specific to each object created from the class. They are defined within `__init__` (or other methods) using `self.attribute_name = value`.
*   **Instance Methods (`bark`, `sit`, `stand`, `get_details`):** These are functions defined inside a class that operate on the instance's attributes. They always take `self` as their first parameter.

Creating Objects (Instances)
----------------------------
To create an object (instance) of a class, you call the class name as if it were a function, passing any arguments required by the `__init__` method (excluding `self`).

.. code-block:: python

    # Create Dog objects (instances of the Dog class)
    dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3, "Golden Retriever") # __init__ is called here
    # Output: Dog named Buddy created!

    dog2 = Dog("Lucy", 5, "Poodle")
    # Output: Dog named Lucy created!

    dog3 = Dog("Max", 1) # Uses default breed "Unknown"
    # Output: Dog named Max created!

    # Now dog1, dog2, and dog3 are objects of the Dog class.

Accessing Attributes and Calling Methods
----------------------------------------
You access an object's attributes and call its methods using dot notation (`object.attribute` or `object.method()`).

.. code-block:: python

    # Accessing attributes of dog1
    print(f"{dog1.name} is {dog1.age} years old.") # Output: Buddy is 3 years old.
    print(f"{dog1.name}'s breed is {dog1.breed}.") # Output: Buddy's breed is Golden Retriever.
    print(f"{dog1.name} belongs to the species: {dog1.species}") # Accessing class attribute via instance

    # Accessing attributes of dog2
    print(f"{dog2.name} is a {dog2.breed}.") # Output: Lucy is a Poodle.

    # Calling methods
    print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says: Woof!
    print(dog2.bark())  # Output: Lucy says: Woof!

    dog1.sit()          # Output: Buddy is now sitting.
    dog1.sit()          # Output: Buddy is already sitting.
    dog1.stand()        # Output: Buddy is now standing.

    print(dog3.get_details()) # Output: Name: Max, Age: 1, Breed: Unknown, Species: Canis familiaris

    # Accessing class attribute directly from the class
    print(f"All dogs are of species: {Dog.species}") # Output: All dogs are of species: Canis familiaris

Modifying Attributes
--------------------
You can modify an object's attributes directly (if not protected by encapsulation techniques).

.. code-block:: python
    print(f"Dog1's age before: {dog1.age}") # Output: Dog1's age before: 3
    dog1.age = 4 # Modify the age
    print(f"Dog1's age after: {dog1.age}")  # Output: Dog1's age after: 4

----------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation (Information Hiding)
==================================

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). It also often implies **information hiding**, which means restricting direct access to some of an object's internal state. This helps prevent accidental modification of data and makes the class easier to maintain.

Python doesn't have strict "private" keywords like Java or C++. Instead, it relies on naming conventions:

1.  **Single Underscore Prefix (`_attribute_name`):**
    *   This is a convention indicating that an attribute or method is intended for **internal use** within the class or its subclasses.
    *   It's a hint to other developers not to access it directly from outside the class.
    *   Python does *not* prevent access; it's purely a convention.

    .. code-block:: python
        class BankAccount:
            def __init__(self, account_holder, initial_balance):
                self.account_holder = account_holder
                self._balance = initial_balance # Intended for internal use

            def deposit(self, amount):
                if amount > 0:
                    self._balance += amount
                    print(f"Deposited ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self._balance:.2f}")
                else:
                    print("Deposit amount must be positive.")

            def withdraw(self, amount):
                if 0 < amount <= self._balance:
                    self._balance -= amount
                    print(f"Withdrew ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self._balance:.2f}")
                else:
                    print("Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient funds.")

            def get_balance(self): # "Getter" method
                return self._balance

        acc = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)
        acc.deposit(500)
        # print(acc._balance) # Conventionally, you shouldn't do this directly.
        print(f"Alice's balance: ${acc.get_balance():.2f}") # Use the getter method instead.

2.  **Double Underscore Prefix (`__attribute_name`):**
    *   This triggers **name mangling**. Python changes the name of the attribute to `_ClassName__attribute_name`.
    *   This makes it harder (but not impossible) to accidentally access or override the attribute from outside the class or in subclasses.
    *   It's primarily used to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.

    .. code-block:: python
        class MySecretClass:
            def __init__(self):
                self.public_var = "I am public"
                self._protected_var = "I am protected"
                self.__private_var = "I am very private!" # Name mangling will occur

            def display_private(self):
                print(self.__private_var)

        secret_obj = MySecretClass()
        print(secret_obj.public_var)
        print(secret_obj._protected_var) # Accessible, but by convention, don't touch

        # print(secret_obj.__private_var) # This will cause an AttributeError
        # Name mangling means it's actually stored as _MySecretClass__private_var
        print(secret_obj._MySecretClass__private_var) # This works, but defeats the purpose
        secret_obj.display_private() # Use a public method to access it if intended

Encapsulation is achieved by providing public methods (like `deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`) to interact with the internal state (`_balance`) rather than modifying it directly.

----------------------------------------------------

Inheritance
===========

Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a `GoldenRetriever` *is a* `Dog`).

Syntax: `class SubClassName(SuperClassName):`

.. code-block:: python

    # Base class (Superclass)
    class Animal:
        def __init__(self, name, sound="Some generic sound"):
            self.name = name
            self.sound = sound
            print(f"Animal '{self.name}' created.")

        def speak(self):
            return f"{self.name} says {self.sound}!"

        def eat(self):
            print(f"{self.name} is eating.")

    # Derived class (Subclass) - inherits from Animal
    class Dog(Animal): # Dog inherits from Animal
        def __init__(self, name, breed, sound="Woof"):
            # Call the __init__ method of the superclass (Animal)
            super().__init__(name, sound) # Initializes 'name' and 'sound' from Animal
            self.breed = breed # Add a new attribute specific to Dog
            print(f"Dog of breed '{self.breed}' created.")

        # Dog inherits speak() and eat() methods from Animal

        # Dog can also have its own specific methods
        def fetch(self, item):
            return f"{self.name} fetches the {item}."

        # Method Overriding: Provide a specific implementation for a method from the superclass
        def speak(self):
            # You can call the superclass's method if needed:
            # animal_sound = super().speak()
            # return f"{animal_sound} And specifically, {self.name} barks loudly!"
            return f"{self.name} the {self.breed} barks: {self.sound}!"


    class Cat(Animal): # Cat also inherits from Animal
        def __init__(self, name, color, sound="Meow"):
            super().__init__(name, sound)
            self.color = color
            print(f"Cat of color '{self.color}' created.")

        # Cat has its own speak method (overriding)
        def speak(self):
            return f"{self.name} the {self.color} cat purrs: {self.sound}"

        def chase_laser(self):
            return f"{self.name} is chasing the laser pointer!"

    # Create instances
    generic_animal = Animal("Creature")
    # Output: Animal 'Creature' created.

    buddy_the_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
    # Output:
    # Animal 'Buddy' created.
    # Dog of breed 'Golden Retriever' created.

    whiskers_the_cat = Cat("Whiskers", "Gray")
    # Output:
    # Animal 'Whiskers' created.
    # Cat of color 'Gray' created.

    print(generic_animal.speak()) # Output: Creature says Some generic sound!
    generic_animal.eat()          # Output: Creature is eating.

    print(buddy_the_dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy the Golden Retriever barks: Woof! (Dog's overridden method)
    buddy_the_dog.eat()           # Output: Buddy is eating. (Inherited from Animal)
    print(buddy_the_dog.fetch("ball")) # Output: Buddy fetches the ball. (Dog's own method)

    print(whiskers_the_cat.speak()) # Output: Whiskers the Gray cat purrs: Meow (Cat's overridden method)
    print(whiskers_the_cat.chase_laser()) # Output: Whiskers is chasing the laser pointer!

Key points about Inheritance:
*   **`super().__init__(...)`**: Used to call the constructor of the parent class, ensuring that the parent's initialization logic is executed.
*   **Method Overriding:** If a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass, the subclass's method will be called for instances of the subclass. This allows for specialized behavior.
*   Subclasses inherit all public and protected attributes and methods from their superclass. They can add new attributes and methods or override existing ones.

----------------------------------------------------

Polymorphism
============

Polymorphism (literally "many forms") means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. It often manifests when different classes share a method name (due to inheritance or just by convention, known as "duck typing" in Python), and the specific action performed depends on the actual type of the object.

Example using the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` classes:
.. code-block:: python

    def animal_interaction(animal_object):
        """This function can interact with any object that has a speak() and eat() method."""
        print("--- Interacting with animal ---")
        print(animal_object.speak()) # Calls the specific speak() method of the object's class
        animal_object.eat()
        # If the object has a unique method, we might need to check its type
        if isinstance(animal_object, Dog):
            print(animal_object.fetch("stick"))
        elif isinstance(animal_object, Cat):
            print(animal_object.chase_laser())
        print("-----------------------------")


    # Create a list of different animal objects
    animals = [
        Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd"),
        Cat("Fluffy", "Persian"),
        Animal("Unknown Beast", "Roar") # A generic Animal instance
    ]

    # Iterate and call the same method name on different objects
    print("\n--- Demonstrating Polymorphism ---")
    for animal in animals:
        animal_interaction(animal)
        # Output will vary based on the actual type of 'animal'
        # For Dog: Animal 'Rex' created. Dog of breed 'German Shepherd' created.
        # For Cat: Animal 'Fluffy' created. Cat of color 'Persian' created.
        # For Animal: Animal 'Unknown Beast' created.
        # --- Interacting with animal ---
        # Rex the German Shepherd barks: Woof!
        # Rex is eating.
        # Rex fetches the stick
        # -----------------------------
        # --- Interacting with animal ---
        # Fluffy the Persian cat purrs: Meow
        # Fluffy is eating.
        # Fluffy is chasing the laser pointer!
        # -----------------------------
        # --- Interacting with animal ---
        # Unknown Beast says Roar!
        # Unknown Beast is eating.
        # -----------------------------

Polymorphism allows for writing more generic and flexible code. The `animal_interaction` function doesn't need to know the exact type of animal it's dealing with to call `speak()` or `eat()`, as long as the animal object provides those methods.

**Duck Typing:** Python's approach to polymorphism is often described by the phrase "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck." This means Python focuses on an object's behavior (what methods it has) rather than its explicit type or class hierarchy. If an object has the necessary methods, it can be used in a polymorphic way, even if it doesn't inherit from a common base class.

----------------------------------------------------

Benefits of OOP
---------------
*   **Modularity:** Objects are self-contained entities. This makes programs easier to design, develop, and debug.
*   **Reusability:** Classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in different programs. Inheritance allows extending existing classes with minimal new code.
*   **Maintainability:** OOP code is often easier to understand and maintain because it's organized around objects that model real-world concepts. Changes to one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts.
*   **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to hide complex implementation details behind a simple interface. Users of a class only need to know *what* an object can do, not *how* it does it.
*   **Scalability:** Well-designed OOP systems can be more easily scaled and extended to accommodate new features.

----------------------------------------------------

Mini-Project: Simple Library Management System
==============================================

Let's create a very simple library management system using OOP concepts.

**Entities to Model:**
1.  `Book`:
    *   Attributes: `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `is_borrowed` (boolean, default `False`).
    *   Methods: `display_info()`, `borrow_book()`, `return_book()`.
2.  `Member`:
    *   Attributes: `name`, `member_id`, `borrowed_books` (a list of `Book` objects).
    *   Methods: `borrow_book(book_object)`, `return_book(book_object)`, `display_borrowed_books()`.
3.  `Library`:
    *   Attributes: `books` (a list of `Book` objects available in the library), `members` (a list of `Member` objects).
    *   Methods: `add_book(book_object)`, `register_member(member_object)`, `find_book(title_or_isbn)`, `lend_book(member_id, book_title)`, `accept_book_return(member_id, book_title)`.

**Goal:**
*   Define these classes with appropriate `__init__` methods and other methods.
*   In a `main` section, create a few `Book` objects and `Member` objects.
*   Create a `Library` object and add the books and members to it.
*   Simulate a member borrowing a book and returning a book.
*   Display information.

**Simplified Logic:**
*   When a member borrows a book, the book's `is_borrowed` status changes, and it's added to the member's `borrowed_books` list. The book should also ideally be marked as unavailable in the library's main list of books (or managed such that only available books are lendable).
*   Error handling for "book not found," "book already borrowed," etc.

Module 9 Summary
================

Excellent work on completing Module 9! Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental paradigm that significantly enhances how you design and build software. You've learned about:

*   The core OOP concepts: **classes, objects, attributes, and methods**.
*   Defining classes with `class` and creating instances (objects).
*   The `__init__` method for initializing objects and the role of `self`.
*   **Encapsulation** for bundling data and methods, and information hiding conventions (`_` and `__`).
*   **Inheritance** for creating class hierarchies and reusing code (`super()`).
*   **Method overriding** to provide specialized behavior in subclasses.
*   The basics of **polymorphism** and how it enables flexible code design (including duck typing).

OOP helps you write code that is more modular, reusable, maintainable, and closer to how we perceive the real world. These concepts are crucial for working with many Python libraries and frameworks, and for developing complex applications.

Next, we're stepping into a very modern and exciting area: "Vibe Coding" – leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in your coding journey!

----------------------------------------------------

Preparing for Module 10: Vibe Coding - AI-Assisted Development
==============================================================

In the upcoming module, we'll explore a revolutionary shift in how developers can approach coding: **Vibe Coding**, or coding with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence, specifically **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and others.

These AI tools are not here to replace developers but to act as powerful assistants, pair programmers, and knowledge resources. Learning to effectively "vibe" with these AIs – understanding how to prompt them, interpret their suggestions, and integrate their output – can significantly boost your productivity, help you learn new concepts, and tackle complex problems.

**What we'll touch upon:**

1.  **Introduction to LLMs in Coding:**
    *   What are LLMs and how do they "understand" and generate code?
    *   Popular LLM tools for coders (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, specialized IDE plugins).
2.  **Effective Prompting for Code Generation:**
    *   **Clarity and Specificity:** How to ask for what you want precisely.
    *   **Context is King:** Providing necessary background, existing code snippets, desired style, or constraints.
    *   **Iterative Prompting:** Refining your requests based on initial AI output.
    *   **Asking for Explanations:** Getting the AI to explain its generated code.
3.  **Debugging with LLMs:**
    *   Pasting error messages and code snippets to get diagnostic help.
    *   Asking for potential causes and solutions.
    *   Using LLMs to refactor or simplify problematic code.
4.  **Maximizing Code Quality with AI Assistance:**
    *   **Review and Verification:** *Never blindly trust AI-generated code.* Always review, understand, and test it.
    *   **Requesting Best Practices:** Asking the AI to adhere to specific coding standards, write comments, or include error handling.
    *   **Generating Test Cases:** Using LLMs to help write unit tests for your code (or AI-generated code).
    *   **Refactoring and Optimization:** Asking for suggestions to improve code readability, efficiency, or structure.
5.  **Best Practices in "Vibe Coding":**
    *   **Understand, Don't Just Copy-Paste:** Focus on learning from the AI's suggestions.
    *   **Start Small, Iterate:** Use AI for manageable chunks of code first.
    *   **Security and Privacy:** Be mindful of what code or data you share with external AI services. Avoid pasting sensitive information.
    *   **Human Oversight is Crucial:** You are still the lead developer. The AI is a tool.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** Awareness of biases in LLMs and responsible use.
    *   **Know the Limits:** LLMs can make mistakes ("hallucinate") or produce suboptimal code.

This next module will be less about learning new Python syntax and more about learning a new *way* of working with code, leveraging cutting-edge AI to enhance your development workflow. Get ready to explore the future of coding!
