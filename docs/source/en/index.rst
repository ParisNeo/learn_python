   module0_getting_started
   module1_variables_and_data_types
   module2_control_flow
   module3_data_structures_lists_tuples
   module4-data-structures-dictionaries-sets

.. note::
   If you have other general pages like an "About this Course" or a "Glossary"
   that are not part of a specific module, you can add another ``toctree``
   for them or list them separately if they are just a few.
   For now, focusing on the modules is a good start.
